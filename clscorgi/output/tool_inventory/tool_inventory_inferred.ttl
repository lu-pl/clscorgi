    rdfs:comment "This class comprises associations between an instance of any class, and signs or arrangements of signs that are used to refer to and identify that instance. Signs include alphanumeric characters, ideograms, notations such as chemical structure symbols, sound symbols, etc. The scripts or type sets for the symbols used to compose an instance of F12 Nomen have to be sufficiently specified. Spelling variants are regarded as different nomens, whereas the use of different fonts (visual representation variants) or different digital encodings do not change the identity. An arbitrary combination of signs or symbols cannot be regarded as an appellation or designation until it is associated with something in some context. In that sense, the F12 Nomen class can be understood as the reification of a relationship between an instance of E1 CRM Entity and an instance of E41 Appellation. Two instances of F12 Nomen can happen to be associated with equivalent strings and yet remain distinct, as long as they refer to distinct instances of E1 CRM Entity. Furthermore, two instances of F12 Nomen referring to the same instance of E1 CRM Entity may be associated with equivalent strings, and remain distinct as long as they are associated with distinct properties of the F12 Nomen class (for example, having the same spelling in different languages, or being defined in different controlled vocabularies). An instance of F12 Nomen associates a combination of signs with an instance of E1 CRM Entity on the basis of a cultural or linguistic convention: by associating a string with anything, the instance of F12 Nomen establishes a meaning that is not inherent in the instance of E62 String that is associated with it. Depending on context of use, nomens associated with equivalent strings can be associated with instances of different things in the real world even within the same language (polysemy and homonymy). Conversely, the same thing can be referred to through any number of nomens (synonymy). In the controlled environment of a bibliographic information system, though, homonymy is avoided Instances of F12 Nomen are assigned and associated with instances of E1 CRM Entity either formally (such as by bibliographic agencies) or informally through common usage. When they are assigned formally, the construction of the instances of E62 String that represent them may follow predetermined rules."@en ;

A Work is the outcome of an intellectual process of one or more persons. Inherent to the notion of work is the existence of recognisable realizations of the work in the form of one or more expressions. Works are often regarded as finished and discrete e.g. when declared as such by the creator of the work or based on the elaboration or logical coherence of its content. However, works may be recognized as existing but unfinished e.g. if the creators deliberately or accidentally never explicitly finished a particular Expression but have left behind partial expressions. In the absence of explicit information about the initial conception, which is rarely available, the first expression created constitutes witness of the beginning of existence of a Work. A Work can evolve over time, such as through revised editions. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously, in parallel, or over time. Additional expressions of a Work can continue to be created over time. The boundaries of a Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept. The main purpose of this class is to enable bringing together intellectually equivalent Expressions in order to display to a user all available alternatives of the same intellectual or artistic content."@en ;

An instance of F27 Work Creation can serve to document the period a work was coming into existence and the circumstances of it, when these are known. An instance of F27 Work Creation marks the initial creation of an instance of F1 Work through expressions or other externalisations that are sufficiently elaborated so that the characteristic conceptual identity of the work could be recognized as existing. In many cases this will coincide with the first known complete externalisation of an expression of the work. In other cases, the initial creation of an instance of F1 Work may be inferred from multiple, or later, expressions or other forms of evidence. For instance, commissioning of a work may explicitly be agreed on after the presentation of an already complete and detailed elaboration of the work that was not made public. Performances may be prior to written expressions, as in the case of Shakespeare’s works.

An instance of F2 Expression is considered to be created when it is captured on a carrier other than the creator’s brain.

F28 Expression Creation is a subclass of E12 Production because the recording of the expression causes a physical modification of the E18 Physical Thing that serves as the carrier. The creation of an instance of F2 Expression coincides with the creation of the first instance of F3 Manifestation that R4 embodies (is embodied in) this instance of F2 Expression. The P2 has type (is type of) property can be used to specify the type of the instance of F28 Expression Creation (i.e., activities such as translating, revising, or arranging music are types of creation process).

The substance of F2 Expression is signs. An Expression is the outcome of the intellectual or creative process of realizing a Work. Subsequent expressions conveying the same work may be created over time. Expressions do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and an auditor’s brain are taken into account. The form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression. Differences in form imply different Expressions (e.g., from text to spoken word, a transcript of a recording). Similarly, differences in language or means of performance imply different Expressions (e.g., translations or arrangements for different instruments). Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the result is considered to be a new F2 Expression. While theoretically any change in signs will result in a new Expression, conventionally the context and use will determine the rules for distinguishing among expressions. An instance of F2 Expression which includes spoken or written text may be multiply instantiated as an instance of E33 Linguistic Object. This allows for the association of the E56 Language of the text with the instance of F2 Expression by using the property P72 has language (is language of)."@en ;

An F3 Manifestation is the outcome of a publication process where one or more F2 Expressions are prepared for public dissemination, but it may also be a unique form created directly on some material carrier without the intent of being formally published. An instance of F3 Manifestation typically incorporates one or more instances of F2 Expression representing a distinct logical content and all additional input by a publisher such as text layout and cover design. Additionally an F3 Manifestation can be identified by the physical features for the medium of distribution, if applicable. For example, publications in the form of hard-cover and paperback editions would be two distinct instances of F3 Manifestation, even though authorial and editorial content are otherwise identical in both publications. In the case of industrial products such as printed books or music CDs, but also digital material, an instance of F3 Manifestation can be regarded as the prototype for all copies of it. In these cases, an instance of F3 Manifestation specifies all of the features or traits that instances of F5 Item display in order to be copies of a particular publication. In the case of industrial products, instances of F3 Manifestation are also instances of E99 Product Type, normally nowadays identified by characteristic identifiers such as ISBN numbers."@en ;

    rdfs:comment "This class comprises recognizable groups or organizations of persons that have the potential of acting as a unit to produce some intentional result of bibliographic interest for which they can be collectively considered responsible. A group of people becomes an instance of F55 Collective Agent when it identifies itself by a name that identifies it within an appropriate context and exhibits sufficient organizational characteristics to permit it to perform actions that reflect agency. Groups that are constituted as meetings, conferences, congresses, expeditions, festivals, fairs, etc. are examples of F55 Collective Agent as long as they self-identify by a specific name, rather than being referred to by a generic description of the gathering, and can act as a unit (such as by publishing their proceedings, or approving a report). These collective actions may be performed by representatives selected by the whole, rather than by all individual members acting together. Collective Agents may be members of other Collective Agents, although directly or indirectly all Collective Agents are composed of persons. The membership of many types of Collective Agents will continue to evolve over time. A Collective Agent may continue to exist even if it has no members for a time (for example, a committee whose members all resign prior to the expiration of their terms but then a new complement of members is appointed). Instances of F55 Collective Agent include instances of its subclass F11 Corporate Body: commercial or corporate entities and other legally registered bodies, as well as organizations and associations, musical, artistic or performing groups, governments, and any of their sub-units. Married couples and other concepts of family (instances of F39 Family) are instances of a subclass of F55 Collective Agent. In the wider sense, this class also comprises holders of official positions viewed collectively, independent of the current holder of the office, such as the president of a country. In such cases, it is possible that the instance of F55 Collective Agent has only ever had a single member. A group of persons known by/using a joint pseudonym (i.e., a name that seems indicative of an individual but that is actually adopted as a persona by two or more people acting together) is a case of F55 Collective Agent."@en ;

    rdfs:comment "This class comprises physical objects (printed books, scores, CDs, DVDs, CD-ROMS, etc.) that were produced by (P186i) an industrial process involving a given instance of F3 Manifestation. As a result, all the instances of F5 Item associated with a given instance of F3 Manifestation are expected to carry the content defined in that instance of F3 Manifestation, although some or even all of them may happen to carry a content that significantly differs from it, due to either an accident in the course of industrial production, or subsequent physical modification or degradation. An instance of F5 Item that consists of a physical object or set of objects with clear physical boundaries is also an instance of E22 Human-Made Object. An instance of F5 Item that is stored on a part of a larger physical support (such as an electronic file among others on a disc) can also be considered to be an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. The notion of F5 Item is only relevant with regard to the production process, from a bibliographic point of view. The physical units managed by cultural heritage institutions in their holdings are a distinct notion: a unit of holdings certainly can be equal to an instance of F5 Item, but it also can be either “bigger” than one (e.g., when two instances of F5 Item are bound together (in the case of printed books)), or “smaller” than one (e.g., for incomplete holdings, such as when only one CD from a two-CD set is held). From an operational point of view, cultural heritage institutions typically do not manage instances of F5 Item, but physical holdings units, instances of E19 Physical Object, although for libraries in most cases this is not significant because each item corresponds with a single unit. When this is not the case, the linkage between items and the units relevant for collection management can be recorded through the P46 is composed of (forms part of) property between instances of F5 Item and instances of E19 Physical Object. If needed, an instance of E19 Physical Object can be typed as a unit through the P2 has type (is type of) property."@en ;

Depending on the circumstances, it may describe:
1. the beginning of custody (there is no previous custodian)
2. the end of custody (there is no subsequent custodian)
3. the transfer of custody (transfer from one custodian to the next)
4. the receipt of custody from an unknown source (the previous custodian is unknown)
5. the declared loss of an object (the current or subsequent custodian is unknown)
In the event that only a single kind of transfer of custody occurs, either the legal responsibility for the custody or the actual physical possession of the object but not both, this difference should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of).
The sense of physical possession requires that the object of custody be in the hands of the keeper at least with a part representative for the whole. The way, in which a representative part is defined, should ensure that it is unambiguous who keeps a part and who the whole and should be consistent with the identity criteria of the kept instance of E18 Physical Thing.
The interpretation of the museum notion of "accession" differs between institutions. The CIDOC CRM therefore models legal ownership and physical custody separately. Institutions will then model their specific notions of accession and deaccession as combinations of these.

This class includes the production of an item from raw materials and other so far undocumented objects. It also includes the conservation treatment of an object.
Since the distinction between modification and production is not always clear, modification is regarded as the more generally applicable concept. This implies that some items may be consumed or destroyed in an instance of E11 Modification, and that others may be produced as a result of it. An event should also be documented using an instance of E81 Transformation if it results in the destruction of one or more objects and the simultaneous production of others using parts or material from the originals. In this case, the new items have separate identities.
An activity undertaken on an object which was designed to alter it, but which, in fact, it did not in any seemingly significant way (such as the application of a solvent during conservation which failed to dissolve any part of the object), is still considered as an instance of E11 Modification. Typically, any such activity will leave at least forensic traces of evidence on the object.

It specializes the notion of modification into production. The decision as to whether or not an object is regarded as new is context sensitive. Normally, items are considered “new” if there is no obvious overall similarity between them and the consumed items and material used in their production. In other cases, an item is considered “new” because it becomes relevant to documentation by a modification. For example, the scribbling of a name on a potsherd may make it a voting token. The original potsherd may not be worth documenting, in contrast to the inscribed one.

For example, the class describes the actions of people making propositions and statements during certain scientific/scholarly procedures, e.g. the person and date when a condition statement was made, an identifier was assigned, the museum object was measured, etc. Which kinds of such assignments and statements need to be documented explicitly in structures of a schema rather than free text, depends on whether this information should be accessible by structured queries.
This class allows for the documentation of how the respective assignment came about, and whose opinion it was. Note that all instances of properties described in a knowledge base are the opinion of someone. Per default, they are the opinion of the team maintaining the knowledge base. This fact must not individually be registered for all instances of properties provided by the maintaining team, because it would result in an endless recursion of whose opinion was the description of an opinion. Therefore, the use of instances of E13 Attribute Assignment marks the fact that the maintaining team is in general neutral to the validity of the respective assertion, but registers someone else’s opinion and how it came about.

An instance of E16 Measurement may use simple counting or tools, such as yardsticks or radiation detection devices. The interest is in the method and care applied, so that the reliability of the result may be judged at a later stage, or research continued on the associated documents. The date of the event is important for dimensions, which may change value over time, such as the length of an object subject to shrinkage. Methods and devices employed should be associated with instances of E16 Measurement by properties such as P33 used specific technique: E29 Design or Procedure, P125 used object of type: E55 Type, P16 used specific object (was used for): E70 Thing, whereas basic techniques such as "carbon-14 dating" should be encoded using P2 has type (is type of): E55 Type. Details of methods and devices reused or reusable in other instances of E16 Measurement should be documented for these entities rather than the measurements themselves, whereas details of particular execution may be documented by free text or by instantiating adequate sub-activities, if the detail may be of interest for an overarching query.
Regardless whether a measurement is made by an instrument or by human senses, it represents the initial transition from physical reality to information without any other documented information object in between within the reasoning chain that would represent the result of the interaction of the observer or device with reality. Therefore, determining properties of an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is regarded as an instance of E13 Attribute Assignment, which may be inferred from observing and measuring representative carriers. In the case that the carrier can be named, the property P16 used specific object (was used for) should be used to indicate the instance(s) of E18 Physical Thing that was used as the empirical basis for the attribute assignment. For instance, inferring properties of depicted items using image material, such as satellite images, is not regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement, but as a subsequent instance of E13 Attribute Assignment. Rather, only the production of the images, understood as arrays of radiation intensities, is regarded as an instance of E16 Measurement. The same reasoning holds for other sensor data.""" ;

    rdfs:comment """This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.
It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.
Often, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.
E4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr &amp; Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.
Typical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.
A geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice. The spatiotemporal properties of Geopolitical units can be modelled through the properties inherited from E92 Spacetime Volume.
Another specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the actual extent of the set of activities and phenomena as evidenced by their physical traces that define a settlement, such as the populated period of Nineveh.""" ;

Instances of E52 Time-Span have no semantic connotations about phenomena happening within the temporal extent they represent. They do not convey any meaning other than a positioning on the “time-line” of chronology. The actual extent of an instance of E52 Time-Span can be approximated by properties of E52 Time-Span giving inner and outer bounds in the form of dates (instances of E61 Time Primitive). Comparing knowledge about time-spans is fundamental for chronological reasoning.
Some instances of E52 Time-Span may be defined as the actual, in principle observable, temporal extent of instances of E2 Temporal Entity via the property P4 has time-span (is time-span of): E52 Time-Span. They constitute phenomenal time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr &amp; Hiebel 2013). Since our knowledge of history is imperfect and physical phenomena are fuzzy in nature, the extent of phenomenal time-spans can only be described in approximation. An extreme case of approximation, might, for example, define an instance of E52 Time-Span having unknown beginning, end and duration. It may, nevertheless, be associated with other descriptions by which people can infer knowledge about it, such as in relative chronologies.
Some instances of E52 may be defined precisely as representing a declaration of a temporal extent, as, for instance, done in a business contract. They constitute declarative time-spans as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr &amp; Hiebel 2013) and can be described via the property E61 Time Primitive P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span.

They may serve describing the physical location of things or phenomena or other areas of interest. Geometrically, instances of E53 Place constitute single contiguous areas or a finite aggregation of disjoint areas in space which are each individually contiguous. They may have fuzzy boundaries.
The instances of E53 Place are usually determined by reference to the position of “immobile” objects such as buildings, cities, mountains, rivers, or dedicated geodetic marks, but may also be determined by reference to mobile objects. A Place can be determined by combining a frame of reference and a location with respect to this frame.
It is sometimes argued that instances of E53 Place are best identified by global coordinates or absolute reference systems. However, relative references are often more relevant in the context of cultural documentation and tend to be more precise. In particular, people are often interested in position in relation to large, mobile objects, such as ships. For example, the Place at which Nelson died is known with reference to a large mobile object, i.e. H.M.S Victory. A resolution of this Place in terms of absolute coordinates would require knowledge of the movements of the vessel and the precise time of death, either of which may be revised, and the result would lack historical and cultural relevance.

An instance of E54 Dimension represents the empirical or theoretically derived quantity, including the precision tolerances resulting from the particular method or calculation. The identity of an instance of E54 Dimension depends on the method of its determination because each method may produce different values even when determining comparable qualities. For instance, the wingspan of a bird alive or dead is a different dimension. Thermoluminescence dating and Rehydroxylation [RHX] dating are different dimensions of temporal distance from now, even if they aim at dating the same object. The method of determination should be expressed using the property P2 has type (is type of). Note that simple terms such as “diameter” or “length” are normally insufficient to unambiguously describe a respective dimension. In contrast, “maximum linear extent” may be sufficient.
The properties of the class E54 Dimension allow for expressing the numerical approximation of the values of instances of E54 Dimension adequate to the precision of the applied method of determination. If the respective quantity belongs to a non-discrete space according to the laws of physics, such as spatial distances, it is recommended to record them as approximations by intervals or regions of indeterminacy enclosing the assumed true values. For instance, a length of 5 cm may be recorded as 4.5-5.5 cm, according to the precision of the respective observation. Note, that comparability of values described in different units depends critically on the representation as value regions.

These can be represented in the CIDOC CRM as subclasses of E55 Type, forming hierarchies of terms, i.e. instances of E55 Type linked via P127 has broader term (has narrower term): E55 Type. Such hierarchies may be extended with additional properties.""" ;

Typical examples are meetings, births, deaths, actions of decision taking, making or inventing things, but also more complex and extended ones such as conferences, elections, building of a castle, or battles.
While the continuous growth of a tree lacks the limits characteristic of an event, its germination from a seed does qualify as an event. Similarly, the blowing of the wind lacks the distinctness and limits of an event, but a hurricane, flood or earthquake would qualify as an event. Mental processes are considered as events, in cases where they are connected with the material externalization of their results; for example, the creation of a poem, a performance or a change of intention that becomes obvious from subsequent actions or declarations.
The effects of an instance of E5 Event may not lead to relevant permanent changes of properties or relations of the items involved in it, for example an unrecorded performance. Of course, in order to be documented, some kind of evidence for an event must exist, be it witnesses, traces or products of the event.
While instances of E4 Period always require some form of coherence between its constituent phenomena, in addition, the essential constituents of instances of E5 Event should contribute to an overall effect; for example, the statements made during a meeting and the listening of the audience.
Viewed at a coarse level of detail, an instance of E5 Event may appear as if it had an ‘instantaneous’ overall effect, but any process or interaction of material nature in reality have an extent in time and space. At a fine level, instances of E5 Event may be analysed into component phenomena and phases within a space and timeframe, and as such can be seen as a period, regardless of the size of the phenomena.

A gathering of people becomes an instance of E74 Group when it exhibits organizational characteristics usually typified by a set of ideas or beliefs held in common, or actions performed together. These might be communication, creating some common artifact, a common purpose such as study, worship, business, sports, etc. Nationality can be modelled as membership in an instance of E74 Group.

    rdfs:comment """This class comprises items that have persistent characteristics of structural nature substantially related to their identity and their integrity, sometimes known as “endurants” in philosophy. Persistent Items may be physical entities, such as people, animals or things, conceptual entities such as ideas, concepts, products of the imagination or even names.
Instances of E77 Persistent Item may be present or be part of interactions in different periods or events. They can repeatedly be recognized at disparate occasions during their existence by characteristics of structural nature. The respective characteristics need not be exactly the same during all the existence of an instance of E77 Persistent Item. Often, they undergo gradual change, still bearing some similarities with that of previous times, or disappear completely and new emerge. For instance, a person, from the time of being born on, will gradually change all its features and acquire new ones, such as a scar. Even the DNA in different body cells will develop defects and mutations. Nevertheless, relevant characteristics used should be sufficiently similar to recognize the instance for some substantial period of time.
The more specific criteria that determine the identity of instances of subclasses of E77 Persistent Item may vary considerably and are described or referred to in the respective scope notes. The decision about which exact criteria to use depends on whether the observable behaviour of the respective part of reality such confined conforms to the reasoning the user is interested in. For example, a building can be regarded as no longer existing if it is dismantled and the materials reused in a different configuration. On the other hand, human beings go through radical and profound changes during their life-span, affecting both material composition and form, yet preserve their identity by other criteria, such as being bodily separated from other persons. Similarly, inanimate objects may be subject to exchange of parts and matter. On the opposite, the identity of a (version of a) text of a scientific publication is given by the exact arrangement of its relevant symbols.
The main classes of objects that fall outside the scope of the E77 Persistent Item class are temporal objects such as periods, events and acts, and descriptive properties.
An instance of E77 Persistent Item does not require actual knowledge of the identifying features of the instance being currently known. There may be cases, where the actual identifying features of an instance of E77 Persistent Item are not decidable at a particular state of knowledge.""" ;

Respective phenomena may, for instance, be historical events or periods, but can also be the diachronic extent and existence of physical things. In other words, instances of this class fix a slice of another instance of E92 Spacetime Volume in time.
The temporal extent of an instance of E93 Presence typically is predetermined by the researcher so as to focus the investigation particularly on finding the spatial extent of the phenomenon by testing for its characteristic features. There are at least two basic directions such investigations might take. The investigation may wish to determine where something was during some time or it may wish to reconstruct the total passage of a phenomenon’s spacetime volume through an examination of discrete presences. Observation and measurement of features indicating the presence or absence of a phenomenon in some space allows for the progressive approximation of spatial extents through argumentation typically based on inclusion, exclusion and various overlaps.""" ;

It is typical of instances of E22 Human-Made Object that conform to an instance of E99 Product Type that its component parts are interchangeable with component parts of other instances of E22 Human-Made Object made after the model of the same instance of E99 Product Type. Frequently, the uniform production according to a given instance of E99 Product Type is achieved by creating individual tools, such as moulds or print plates that are themselves carriers of the design of the product type. Modern tools may use the flexibility of electronically controlled devices to achieve such uniformity. The product type itself, i.e. the potentially unlimited series of aesthetically equivalent items, may be the target of artistic design, rather than the individual object. In extreme cases, only one instance of a product type may have been produced, such as in a “print on demand” process which was only triggered once.

This is the implementation approved by the 58th CRM-SIG meeting (March 2024)
as the current RDFS version for the CIDOC CRM namespace.
Note that this is NOT a definition of the CIDOC CRM, but a CIDOC CRM compatible implementation
of an RDF Schema derived from the authoritative release of the CIDOC CRM v7.1.3 on February 2024
https://cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-7.1.3 by an automated algorithm. It is intended for an
assumed majority of uses. Depending on the application, users may create adequate extensions 
compatible with the logical definitions of the CIDOC CRM.

Created by FORTH-ICS February 13, 2024
CC BY 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode



Encoding Rules:
1. The RDF spelling rules do not allow blanks. Hence we have replaced them by underscores.
   For instance "E63_Beginning_of_Existence" or "P2i_is_type_of".

2. RDF does not allow to instantiate properties beginning from a range value.
   Therefore, each CRM property is represented as two RDFS properties.
   For instance "P2 has type (is type of)" is represented as:
   "P2_has_type" for the domain to range direction and "P2i_is_type_of" for the range to domain direction.

3. The primitive values "E60 Number", "E61 Time Primitive", "E62 String", "E94 Space Primitive" and 
   "E95 Spacetime Primitive" referred in the Model for formal completeness are interpreted as rdfs:literal.

4. RDF does not support properties of properties, therefore, users may create their own
   subProperties for CRM properties that have a type property such as "P3 has note":
   Instead of P3 has note (P3-1 has type : parts description) declare
   <rdf:Property rdf:about="P3_parts_description">
      <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="E1_CRM_Entity"/>
      <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"/>
      <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="P3_has_note"/>
   </rdf:Property>

5. Scope notes are represented as <rdfs:comment> elements.

6. In addition this encoding contains labels in languages different from English, 
   which are taken from translations of previous versions of the CIDOC CRM.    

7. Any other differences in labels, scope notes  and semantic relationships of this encoding 
   to the authoritative definition of the CIDOC CRM v7.1.3 (February 2024) are not intended transfer errors. 
   FORTH appreciates your feed-back on such errors.

8. CRM time extension 1.0 Encoded in RDFS (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)
   Since the Time Primitive of the CRM can not directly be implemented in RDF Triple Stores, we define in this extension
   of 4 properties replacing P81 and P82 adequately using xsd:dateTime. 
   Property P81 is dedicated for modeling the Time-Span's maximum known temporal extent i.e. ongoing_throughout. 
   Property P82 is for modeling the minimum outer bounds of events i.e. at_some_time_within. 
   P81 has its time interval redefined by P81a and P81b. Similarly, we redefine P82 by P82a and P82b.
## RDFS Generation Policies

### Sources

Policies followed for the RDFS implementation of CIDOC v.7.1.3 were created w.r.t.:

- Implementing the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model in RDF (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Resources/implementing-the-cidoc-conceptual-reference-model-in-rdf)
- How to implement CRM Time in RDF (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)
- CIDOC-CRM SIG feedback and the general guidelines:
  - Each property is declared twice, forward and backwards, unless no inverse name is defined in parentheses, or domain or range is interpreted as literal
  - All Primitive Values become rdfs:Literal
  - All IsA declarations from/to and between Primitive values are ignored

### Policies

#### **A. CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS**

The CIDOC-CRM model defines classes, that in Triple Stores are typically implemented as primitive values. These classes are all subclasses of `E59 Primitive Value` and in RDFS they are interpreted as Literal. There are some classes in the CIDOC-CRM model that are both subclasses of `E59 Primitive Value` and E41 Appellation. So far we have followed the decision by CRM-SIG in "Issue 394: Solution for Dualism of E41 Appellation and rdfs:label" in 28-11-2018 wrt the question whether these classes should be implemented as rdfs:Class or still be interpreted as rdfs:Literal.

In this version we have followed the following policy regarding CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS:

> A1. CIDOC Classes that are subClasses of `E59 Primitive Value` are interpreted as rdfs:Literal regardless of whether they are also subClasses of another Class.

As a result, the following CIDOC classes were not defined in RDFS:

- `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E60 Number`
- `E61 Time Primitive`
- `E62 String`
- `E94 Space Primitive`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive`

Additionally, the following isA relationships were not defined in RDFS:

- `E59 Primitive Value` `subClassOf` `E1 CRM Entity`
- `E60 Number` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E61 Time Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E61 Time Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E62 String` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E94 Space Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E94 Space Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`

#### **B. CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS**

The decisions in policy A affect the implementation of CIDOC Properties in RDFS. A property cannot define an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:domain, and the backwards direction of a property with an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:range cannot be created for the exact same reason.

Further, the property ranges defined as rdfs:Literal in this implementation do not inherit the properties of the superclasses defined in the CIDOC Model. A separate guideline will describe how to instantiate such properties if at all needed.

Another aspect considered for the implementation of properties in RDFS is whether a distinct inverse property definition should be provided.

In this version we followed the following policies regarding CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS:

> B1. CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever no inverse name for the property has been specified in parentheses in the official CIDOC documentation and property domain is not equal with property range.

As a result, the following properties do not define an inverse direction.

- `E1 CRM Entity. P3 has note: E62 String`
- `E19 Physical Object. P57 has number of parts: E60 Number`
- `E52 Time-Span. P79 beginning is qualified by: E62 String`
- `E52 Time-Span. P80 end is qualified by: E62 String`
- `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`
- `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`
- `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`
- `E53 Place. P171 at some place within: E94 Space Primitive`
- `E53 Place. P172 contains: E94 Space Primitive`
- `E90 Symbolic Object. P190 has symbolic content: E62 String`

> B2. CIDOC Property forward direction is **not** defined whenever property domain is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Similarly, CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever property range is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Further, the instances of classes interpreted as rdfs:Literal, cannot express in RDFs their **inherited** properties that could be expressed according to CIDOC Model.

As a result,

a) The following **direct forward direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:

- `E95 Spacetime Primitive. P169 defines spacetime volume (spacetime volume is defined by): E92 Spacetime Volume`
- `E61 Time Primitive. P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span`

b) The following **direct backwards direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:

- `E94 Space Primitive. P168i defines place (place is defined by): E53 Place`

> B3. Whenever no backwards/inverse property name is specified and property domain matches with property range, then the forward/direct property direction should be used for **both** directions and **no backwards/inverse property** needs to be defined.

As a result, we did not implement a separate backwards/inverse direction for the following CIDOC Properties:

- `E53 Place. P121 overlaps with: E53 Place`
- `E53 Place. P122 borders with: E53 Place`
- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with: E92 Spacetime Volume`
- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P133 is spatiotemporally separated from: E92 Spacetime Volume`

Additionally, all aforementioned redundant backwards/inverse CIDOC Property direction references, are replaced by the respective direct/forward CIDOC Property direction.

- The hierarchical link of  `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132i` was replaced with `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132`.

#### **C. Labels and appellations**

CIDOC-CRM version 7.1.3 defines the below subpropertyOf relations:

- `P168 place is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`
- `P169i spacetime volume is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`
- `P170i time is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`

The range of P168, P169i and P170i is `E94 Space Primitive`, `E95 Spacetime Primitive` and `E61 Time Primitive` respectively, which are all subclasses of `E41 Appellation` and interpreted as `rdfs:Literal` in RDFS, i.e. these three properties are datatype properties. However, the P1 property has range E41 Appellation, i.e. this property is an object property. Since OWL 2 distinguishes between object subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Object_Subproperties), data subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Data_Subproperties) and annotation subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Annotation_Subproperties), and also in OWL-DL the subject and object of a subproperty statement must be either both datatype properties or both object properties (see here (https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#subPropertyOf-def)), we do not include these three subPropertyOf relations in the provided RDFS implementation to avoid inconsistencies when reasoning with OWL 2 and OWL DL. Instead, we provide them in a separate ‘supplementary’ RDFS file which one can use if such inconsistencies are not expected.

In addition, since in the current practice, the property `rdfs:label` is widely used to denote appellations (see CRM-SIG Issue 394 (http://cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-394-solution-for-dualism-of-e41-appellation-and-rdfslabel)), the following `subPropertyOf` relation was also included in the supplementary RDFS file:

- `rdfs:label` subPropertyOf `P1 is identified by`

Note that according to the RDF Schema 1.1 specification, the domain (or range) of a property does not necessarily need to be 'subClassOf' or 'equal' to the domain (or range) of its superproperties. By including this subproperty relation, one can either directly use `rdfs:label` for providing a non-URI identifier/appellation for an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` for associating an additional URI-identifier with an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` and create an intermediate node (i.e. a URI-identifier for instance of `E41_Appellation`) for providing more detailed information about this appellation.

#### **D. Implementing Value Intervals**

The following are property pairs needed to simulate the interval-valued primitive values foreseen by the CRM:

> D1. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'maximum known temporal extent' boundaries specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.

As a result, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E52 Time-Span. P81a end of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)
- `E52 Time-Span. P81b begin of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)

> D2. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'minimum outer bounds' specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.

Consequently, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E52 Time-Span. P82a begin of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)
- `E52 Time-Span. P82b end of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)

> D3. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`, for the upper and lower boundaries specification of `E60 Number`.

Consequently, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E54 Dimension. P90a has lower value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)
- `E54 Dimension. P90b has upper value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)

#### **E. Multiple ISA custom declaration Classes**

The following are declarations of frequently used multiple instantiations as classes with respective multiple IsA (so far only one):

> E1. addition of a new class, defined as subClassOf `E41 Appellation` and `E33 Linguistic Object`, for all Appellations being regarded
specific to or characteristic for a language group and being described indirectly via a URI.

As a result, we have created the following class definition:

- `E33_E41_Linguistic_Appellation` subClass of `E33_Linguistic_Object` and `E41_Appellation`

#### **F. Translations and Scope notes**

> F1. **Translations** Each RDFS Class or Property definition is accompanied by a set of translations expressed as rdfs:labels separated by xml:lang tags. The translation label used for each language is **the most recent** still **valid** translation. Still valid translation may be interpreted in the following ways:

- The English label of the `CurrentVersion` that the current RDFS file is referring to is *almost equal* (accepting only differences regarding multiple spaces) to the English label of the `TranslationVersion` that the translated label was created for. For example, in order to accept a translation for `E22 Human-Made Object` in the CurrentVersion (7.1.3) we should have a translation for E22 that was created based on a CIDOC version that used the same name for E22. The class name of E22 was changed from `E22 Man-Made Object` to `E22 Human-Made Object` in version 6.2.7. So the only **valid** translations would be these that were created based on version 6.2.7 or later. Currently no such translation has been created, so `E22 Human-Made Object` in CurrentVersion (7.1.3) does not define any translation in the RDFS file.

- Another option is to qualify translations as **valid** based on the scope note comparison of `CurrentVersion` and `TranslationVersion`. Since scope notes include formatting information, the comparison should ignore formatting changes.

Currently in this version we follow the option to qualify translations as valid based on the comparison of the respective labels in the corresponding CIDOC versions.

> F2. **Scope notes** are defined as rdfs:comment and include only the text of the official CIDOC-CRM version in English language. Since scope notes are not just simple texts but include formatting data, a simple removal of the formatting data does not always produce a readable format. Therefore we followed the below simple conventions for the transformation of CIDOC-CRM scope note text into a readable rdfs:comment:

- Each Paragraph defines a new line
- Each element in an unordered list defines a new line
- Each element in an ordered list defines a new line prefixed with `'{order}. '`
- Each superscript text is separated from its base with `'-'`
- Each subscript text is separated from its base with `'_'` (none found)

> F3. **Scope notes of Inverse Properties**. Scope notes for the inverse/backwards direction of properties are not defined as they are covered by the definition of the direct/forward direction definition. Whenever the direct/forward property direction of a property `Pxxx` is not defined due to policy **B1**, then its scope note is used as scope note for the inverse/backwards property `Pxxxi`, and labeled as `Scope note for 'Pxxx':`.

    rdfs:comment "CRM Digital is an ontology and RDF Schema to encode metadata about the steps and methods of production (\"provenance\") of digitization products and synthetic digital representations such as 2D, 3D or even animated Models created by various technologies. Its distinct features compared to competitive models is the complete inclusion of the initial physical measurement processes and their parameters. It has been developed as compatible extension of CIDOC CRM, which allows for querying the most relevant facts and returning complete descriptions encoded in this model by generic ISO21127 terms without need to refer to its specific properties. In contrast, competitive models cannot be queried by a more general standard and are restricted to the computational provenance only. Data encoded in the major competitive models can be transformed without loss of meaning into a CRM-Digital-form."@en ;

Also, you can run Udapi on your data directly, while both PMLTQ and Grew need to first create a relational database of your entire data. This also means that you can process larger data with Udapi than with PMLTQ and Grew. 
However, this comes at a cost – you must be able to write a Python script and read developer documentation. So far, the tools has been used in the treebanking community, but there is no fool-proof tutorial yet for newcomers to the field. 
The tool is structured in packages and modules (https://udapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ modules.html). To search trees, the udapi.core package is the relevant one. Nodes and their attributes are represented as object classes with defined properties and methods. To explain the logic of these properties and methods, tutorials tailored to the CLS community are likely to be needed. """ ;

Users can create a user account, verify their mail address, allow authenticated of anonymous access to each corpus and access their corpora online with a simple web browser. No TXM software installation is needed. A similar GUI as TXM desktop is built in the browser to access and analyze corpora, an URL based API allows to start a TXM portal session in a specific command with parameters on a specific corpus. TXM web portals are often used for courses with students.
Depending on access permission settings (e.g., set access permissions to user profiles, allow or disallow access to each corpus or on text level by commands), access can be anonymous (by anybody) or need a connexion and specific rights. This allows to share corpora within working groups. 
TXM portals allows to host rich text editions and combine them with analytic tools. See below for some examples of direct access to text editions inside a corpus hosted in a TXM portal.
A TXM portal is managed by a special user called a ‘portal administrator’ who manages corpora, user accounts and access permissions.
Corpora are first created with the TXM desktop software, then exported in a .txm file and uploaded to a TXM portal.
See the documentation of the tool “TXM desktop” for further details on the kind of corpora that can be hosted and the tools provided for analysis.
A TXM portal doesn’t implement all the analysis tools of the TXM desktop software, but whose two tools share the same platform core and are developped together.
Examples of direct access to a TXM portal by URL API:
- Direct access to an Edition page of an Old French (1225) Holy Grail manuscript transcription highligthing words “dist” and “Lancelot” with a synoptic view of 'facsimile, diplomatic and critical edition': http://portal.textometrie.org/demo?command=edition&path=/GRAAL&textid=qgraal_cm&editions=ms-colonne,diplomatique,courante&wordids=w_106_030047,w_106_030049 
- Direct access to a Concordance of the word 'Lancelot' (then double-click on a line to read the full text): http://portal.textometrie.org/demo?command=concordance&path=/GRAAL&query=%22Lancelot%22 
- Direct access to an Edition page of an ancient Babylonian (-IIth mil.) tablet transcription with synoptic view combining the transliterated version, the cuneiform version and the facsimile image of the tablet: http://portal.textometrie.org/demo/?command=edition&path=/OBLCUNEIF&textid=TXM_cuneif_Ha_S_AbB_2_4&editions=translit,cuneiform,facs&pageid=3

It does not perform tokenization by itself: it uses UDPipe1 to do that, or you can select a language-independent generic script. In comparison to UDPipe1, its language models require more computation power (while the UDPipe1 models are small and fast). On the other hand, it mostly performs better than UDPipe1, since the models are neural-network (BERT) based. 
If you use the R library udpipe by J. Wijffels, mind that it operates with UDPipe 1. If you want to take advantage of the UDPipe2 output, you have to call the UDPipe2 API outside of this library (and then you can of course use the resulting CoNLL-U file with other udpipe functions).    """ ;

It uses language models trained on the Universal Dependencies treebank collection, which you can browse and learn more about at universaldependencies.org. The language models are retrained twice a year, after the regular updates of the treebank collection by the Universal Dependencies Treebanks team. Depending on the changes in the treebank collection, the update may provide more training data for already existing language models or even new language models. 
UDPipe is a state-of-the art system. This means that it is able to learn from less data than older systems. However, the truth is, still, that the quality of the analysis depends on the size of training data related to the complexity of the language. Hence, e. g. languages with rich inflection or very specific syntax need bigger training data. Besides, the UDPipe developers do normally not actively look for external resources for specific languages, such as morphological lexicons. There are known cases of parsers optimized for one given language with bigger data and additional resources, which perform better than UDPipe, e. g. the Magyarlanc parser for Hungarian. 
When considering several parsers for your language, have a look at the evaluation of the UDPipe performance with the models from a given relase here: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe/2/models
When you evaluate this parser for your data, mind to record the model and version you were using. Note that one language can have several separate models from different domains, e. g.  newspapers and data from social networks!

    crm:P03_has_range_literal """TXM can be used to create and analyze four main types of textual corpora:
- written texts (possibly aligned with fac-simile).
- speech transcriptions (possibly synchronized with media files at word level).
- multilingual/parallel corpora.
- and corpora encoded in a table (e.g. answers to a survey, tweets).
TXM can automatically annotate texts with part of speech and lemma with the help of TreeTagger (or other NLP tools) or use linguistic annotations already encoded into the sources.

One specificity of TXM is that it can help analyse any kind of TEI encoded corpus by possibly adapting (with the help of an XSLT transformation stylesheets library) the texts encodings to its internal XML-TEI TXM format and data model if needed.

Another specificity of TXM is that it can help the user to process progressively his corpus from plain text to richly structured XML-TEI encoded text. It offers a continuous range of import modules covering the most frequently used standard formats:
- TXT: for any plain text coming from word processors, PDFs, websites, etc.
- XML: for slightly structured texts (only sentences or paragraphs for example) or linguistically enriched (with XML tags that encode certain words with lexical properties)
- TEI: for texts encoded according to the recommendations of the TEI consortium and which are intended to be capitalized for long-term projects, shared with other initiatives or compatible with archiving systems.

A project can apply TXM to its encoded data progressively, from the simplest way (and most limited to use) to the most complex way (and richest). TXM therefore makes it possible to adapt the costs of corpus encoding according to the real needs of the study, especially when these needs are discovered as the corpus is being analyzed. Under these conditions, TXM assists both the encoding activity and the exploitation of corpora.

When using TEI, TXM helps to build and host online rich HTML 5 + CSS 3 + Javascript based text editions, with possible fac-simile synoptic views (when page image links are simply encoded in <pb/> tags in the documents).

TXM supports various flavors of TEI P4/P5 encoding practices: Perseus, TextGrid, Base de Français Médiéval (BFM), BVH Epistemon, etc. TEI sources are preprocessed by several XSL stylesheets that are delivered with TXM. Other stylesheets are available in the TXM XSL stylesheets library online: http://sourceforge.net/projects/txm/files/library/xsl.

TXM provides four types of tools to analyze a corpus:
- Corpus configuration tools to build specific subcorpora or corpus partitions, based on sets of texts or sets of text structures (inside a text)
- Semi-manual annotation tools at word or word sequence level: through concordance or text reading
- Qualitative analytic tools like word pattern lists, concordances or progression views
- Quantitative analytic tools like word pattern cooccurrents analysis, keyword analysis, and contrastive tools like correspondence factorial analysis or cluster analysis

Every analytic tool uses word patterns expressed with search queries on annotations with the help of different search engines (Corpus Query Processor, TIGER Search or URSQL). For example, word patterns expressed with the CQL query language:
- "aiming": to simply search for the word 'aiming'
- [pos="VERB" & word=".*ing"]: to search for verb forms ending in ".ing" (where Part of Speech annotation is present)
- [lemma="group"] []{0,3} [pos="VERB" & word=".*ing"]: to search for the collocation <group lemma> followed by a <verb with progressive aspect> with at most 3 words in between

TXM makes an analysis working session more fluid by interconnecting the tools as much as possible through hypertextual links located in their result views. For example: a double-click from a density curve of a word pattern in a text (general view of Progression) to the Concordance of this pattern (focused contextual reading), then from a line of this concordance to an Edition page where the occurrence is highlighted (precise reading of the text), then from this page to the Playback of the video corresponding to the transcription at the time the occurrence is pronounced (verification in the primary source).

All statistical models used by the quantitative tools are implemented and documented in R.

Results can be exported as spreadsheets (for data) or images (for visualisations). Texts and annotations can be exported in XML-TEI format. Corpora can be exported as a .txm file to be loaded in another TXM or uploaded to a TXM portal server version for online access and analysis.

TXM tools can be driven by Groovy scripts (a Java based scripting language) or by R scripts.

This tool is compatible with: TreeTagger, UDPipe (prototype), CQP (Corpus Query Processor), CQP as a library version (https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/txm/txm-cqp), R textometry package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/textometry/index.html), R FactoMineR package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html)""" ;

It is updated after each update of the Universal Dependencies treebank collection at universaldependencies.org. Depending on the changes in the treebank collection, the update may provide more training data for already existing language models or even new language models. 
UDPipe is a state-of-the art system. This means that it is able to learn from less data than older systems. However, the truth is, still, that the quality of the analysis depends on the size of training data related to the complexity of the language. Hence, e. g. languages with rich inflection or very specific syntax need bigger training data. Besides, the UDPipe developers do normally not actively look for external resources for specific languages, such as morphological lexicons. There are known cases of parsers optimized for one given language with bigger data and additional resources, which perform better than UDPipe, e. g. the Magyarlanc parser for Hungarian. 
When considering several parsers for your language, have a look at the evaluation of the UDPipe performance with the models from a given relase here: https://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/udpipe/2/models

The GUI is divided into a number of modules reflecting specific research problems. Unlike other similar tools, Calc is task-based, which means that suitable statistical tests have already been pre-selected for a given task, so that users can draw statistically well-founded conclusions based on the input data.
The tool does not process a text. The input is typically numbers (frequencies) and the output is statistical significance, confidence intervals etc.""" ;

"""A TXM portal hosts textual corpora for online access and analysis.
Users can create a user account, verify their mail address, allow authenticated of anonymous access to each corpus and access their corpora online with a simple web browser. No TXM software installation is needed. A similar GUI as TXM desktop is built in the browser to access and analyze corpora, an URL based API allows to start a TXM portal session in a specific command with parameters on a specific corpus. TXM web portals are often used for courses with students.
Depending on access permission settings (e.g., set access permissions to user profiles, allow or disallow access to each corpus or on text level by commands), access can be anonymous (by anybody) or need a connexion and specific rights. This allows to share corpora within working groups. 
TXM portals allows to host rich text editions and combine them with analytic tools. See below for some examples of direct access to text editions inside a corpus hosted in a TXM portal.
A TXM portal is managed by a special user called a ‘portal administrator’ who manages corpora, user accounts and access permissions.
Corpora are first created with the TXM desktop software, then exported in a .txm file and uploaded to a TXM portal.
See the documentation of the tool “TXM desktop” for further details on the kind of corpora that can be hosted and the tools provided for analysis.
A TXM portal doesn’t implement all the analysis tools of the TXM desktop software, but whose two tools share the same platform core and are developped together.
Examples of direct access to a TXM portal by URL API:
- Direct access to an Edition page of an Old French (1225) Holy Grail manuscript transcription highligthing words “dist” and “Lancelot” with a synoptic view of 'facsimile, diplomatic and critical edition': http://portal.textometrie.org/demo?command=edition&path=/GRAAL&textid=qgraal_cm&editions=ms-colonne,diplomatique,courante&wordids=w_106_030047,w_106_030049 
- Direct access to a Concordance of the word 'Lancelot' (then double-click on a line to read the full text): http://portal.textometrie.org/demo?command=concordance&path=/GRAAL&query=%22Lancelot%22 
- Direct access to an Edition page of an ancient Babylonian (-IIth mil.) tablet transcription with synoptic view combining the transliterated version, the cuneiform version and the facsimile image of the tablet: http://portal.textometrie.org/demo/?command=edition&path=/OBLCUNEIF&textid=TXM_cuneif_Ha_S_AbB_2_4&editions=translit,cuneiform,facs&pageid=3 

Examples of public TXM portals:

"""TXM can be used to create and analyze four main types of textual corpora:
- written texts (possibly aligned with fac-simile).
- speech transcriptions (possibly synchronized with media files at word level).
- multilingual/parallel corpora.
- and corpora encoded in a table (e.g. answers to a survey, tweets).
TXM can automatically annotate texts with part of speech and lemma with the help of TreeTagger (or other NLP tools) or use linguistic annotations already encoded into the sources.

One specificity of TXM is that it can help analyse any kind of TEI encoded corpus by possibly adapting (with the help of an XSLT transformation stylesheets library) the texts encodings to its internal XML-TEI TXM format and data model if needed.

Another specificity of TXM is that it can help the user to process progressively his corpus from plain text to richly structured XML-TEI encoded text. It offers a continuous range of import modules covering the most frequently used standard formats:
- TXT: for any plain text coming from word processors, PDFs, websites, etc.
- XML: for slightly structured texts (only sentences or paragraphs for example) or linguistically enriched (with XML tags that encode certain words with lexical properties)
- TEI: for texts encoded according to the recommendations of the TEI consortium and which are intended to be capitalized for long-term projects, shared with other initiatives or compatible with archiving systems.

A project can apply TXM to its encoded data progressively, from the simplest way (and most limited to use) to the most complex way (and richest). TXM therefore makes it possible to adapt the costs of corpus encoding according to the real needs of the study, especially when these needs are discovered as the corpus is being analyzed. Under these conditions, TXM assists both the encoding activity and the exploitation of corpora.

When using TEI, TXM helps to build and host online rich HTML 5 + CSS 3 + Javascript based text editions, with possible fac-simile synoptic views (when page image links are simply encoded in <pb/> tags in the documents).

TXM supports various flavors of TEI P4/P5 encoding practices: Perseus, TextGrid, Base de Français Médiéval (BFM), BVH Epistemon, etc. TEI sources are preprocessed by several XSL stylesheets that are delivered with TXM. Other stylesheets are available in the TXM XSL stylesheets library online: http://sourceforge.net/projects/txm/files/library/xsl.

TXM provides four types of tools to analyze a corpus:
- Corpus configuration tools to build specific subcorpora or corpus partitions, based on sets of texts or sets of text structures (inside a text)
- Semi-manual annotation tools at word or word sequence level: through concordance or text reading
- Qualitative analytic tools like word pattern lists, concordances or progression views
- Quantitative analytic tools like word pattern cooccurrents analysis, keyword analysis, and contrastive tools like correspondence factorial analysis or cluster analysis

Every analytic tool uses word patterns expressed with search queries on annotations with the help of different search engines (Corpus Query Processor, TIGER Search or URSQL). For example, word patterns expressed with the CQL query language:
- "aiming": to simply search for the word 'aiming'
- [pos="VERB" & word=".*ing"]: to search for verb forms ending in ".ing" (where Part of Speech annotation is present)
- [lemma="group"] []{0,3} [pos="VERB" & word=".*ing"]: to search for the collocation <group lemma> followed by a <verb with progressive aspect> with at most 3 words in between

TXM makes an analysis working session more fluid by interconnecting the tools as much as possible through hypertextual links located in their result views. For example: a double-click from a density curve of a word pattern in a text (general view of Progression) to the Concordance of this pattern (focused contextual reading), then from a line of this concordance to an Edition page where the occurrence is highlighted (precise reading of the text), then from this page to the Playback of the video corresponding to the transcription at the time the occurrence is pronounced (verification in the primary source).

All statistical models used by the quantitative tools are implemented and documented in R.

Results can be exported as spreadsheets (for data) or images (for visualisations). Texts and annotations can be exported in XML-TEI format. Corpora can be exported as a .txm file to be loaded in another TXM or uploaded to a TXM portal server version for online access and analysis.

TXM tools can be driven by Groovy scripts (a Java based scripting language) or by R scripts.

This tool is compatible with: TreeTagger, UDPipe (prototype), CQP (Corpus Query Processor), CQP as a library version (https://gitlab.huma-num.fr/txm/txm-cqp), R textometry package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/textometry/index.html), R FactoMineR package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html)""" a rdfs:Resource,

"""This class comprises sets of coherent phenomena or cultural manifestations occurring in time and space.
It is the social or physical coherence of these phenomena that identify an instance of E4 Period and not the associated spatiotemporal extent. This extent is only the “ground” or space in an abstract physical sense that the actual process of growth, spread and retreat has covered. Consequently, different periods can overlap and coexist in time and space, such as when a nomadic culture exists in the same area and time as a sedentary culture. This also means that overlapping land use rights, common among first nations, amounts to overlapping periods.
Often, this class is used to describe prehistoric or historic periods such as the “Neolithic Period”, the “Ming Dynasty” or the “McCarthy Era”, but also geopolitical units and activities of settlements are regarded as special cases of E4 Period. However, there are no assumptions about the scale of the associated phenomena. In particular all events are seen as synthetic processes consisting of coherent phenomena. Therefore, E4 Period is a superclass of E5 Event. For example, a modern clinical birth, an instance of E67 Birth, can be seen as both a single event, i.e. an instance of E5 Event, and as an extended period, i.e. an instance of E4 Period, that consists of multiple physical processes and complementary activities performed by multiple instances of E39 Actor.
E4 Period is a subclass of E2 Temporal Entity and of E92 Spacetime Volume. The latter is intended as a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CIDOC CRMgeo (Doerr &amp; Hiebel, 2013). By virtue of this multiple inheritance, it is possible to discuss the physical extent of an instance of E4 Period without representing each instance of it together with an instance of its associated spacetime volume. This model combines two quite different kinds of substance: an instance of E4 Period is a phenomenon while an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume is an aggregation of points in spacetime. However, the real spatiotemporal extent of an instance of E4 Period is regarded to be unique to it due to all its details and fuzziness; its identity and existence depends uniquely on the identity of the instance of E4 Period. Therefore, this multiple inheritance is unambiguous and effective and furthermore corresponds to the intuitions of natural language.
Typical use of this class in cultural heritage documentation is for documenting cultural and artistic periods. There are two different conceptualisations of ‘artistic style’, defined either by physical features or by historical context. For example, “Impressionism” can be viewed as a period in the European sphere of influence lasting from approximately 1870 to 1905 during which paintings with particular characteristics were produced by a group of artists that included (among others) Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley and Degas. Alternatively, it can be regarded as a style applicable to all paintings sharing the characteristics of the works produced by the Impressionist painters, regardless of historical context. The first interpretation is an instance of E4 Period, and the second defines morphological object types that fall under E55 Type.
A geopolitical unit as a specific case of an instance of E4 Period is the set of activities and phenomena related to the claim of power, the consequences of belonging to a jurisdictional area and an administrative system that establishes a geopolitical unit. Examples from the modern period are countries or administrative areas of countries such as districts whose actions and structures define activities and phenomena in the area that they intend to govern. The borders of geopolitical units are often defined in contracts or treaties although they may deviate from the actual practice.

In common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge.
In more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place.

In common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place.

Tasks you can perform include but are not limited to Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, Parts-of-speech tagging (POS), lemmatization, entity linking, rule-based matching, and text classification. It allows you to train your own domain-specific models – but you can also use the ones provided by the library.
Since the tool is a Python library, you need a programming environment to use it, and knowledge of NLP. For digital humanities purposes, there is a great YouTube series (https://www.youtube.com/@python-programming) which shows how you can use spaCy in different DH settings (from information extraction to visualization).""" a rdfs:Resource,

"""CIDOC CRM v7.1.3 implemented in RDFS

This is the implementation approved by the 58th CRM-SIG meeting (March 2024)
as the current RDFS version for the CIDOC CRM namespace.
Note that this is NOT a definition of the CIDOC CRM, but a CIDOC CRM compatible implementation
of an RDF Schema derived from the authoritative release of the CIDOC CRM v7.1.3 on February 2024
https://cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-7.1.3 by an automated algorithm. It is intended for an
assumed majority of uses. Depending on the application, users may create adequate extensions 
compatible with the logical definitions of the CIDOC CRM.

Created by FORTH-ICS February 13, 2024
CC BY 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode



Encoding Rules:
1. The RDF spelling rules do not allow blanks. Hence we have replaced them by underscores.
   For instance "E63_Beginning_of_Existence" or "P2i_is_type_of".

2. RDF does not allow to instantiate properties beginning from a range value.
   Therefore, each CRM property is represented as two RDFS properties.
   For instance "P2 has type (is type of)" is represented as:
   "P2_has_type" for the domain to range direction and "P2i_is_type_of" for the range to domain direction.

3. The primitive values "E60 Number", "E61 Time Primitive", "E62 String", "E94 Space Primitive" and 
   "E95 Spacetime Primitive" referred in the Model for formal completeness are interpreted as rdfs:literal.

4. RDF does not support properties of properties, therefore, users may create their own
   subProperties for CRM properties that have a type property such as "P3 has note":
   Instead of P3 has note (P3-1 has type : parts description) declare
   <rdf:Property rdf:about="P3_parts_description">
      <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="E1_CRM_Entity"/>
      <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"/>
      <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="P3_has_note"/>
   </rdf:Property>

5. Scope notes are represented as <rdfs:comment> elements.

6. In addition this encoding contains labels in languages different from English, 
   which are taken from translations of previous versions of the CIDOC CRM.    

7. Any other differences in labels, scope notes  and semantic relationships of this encoding 
   to the authoritative definition of the CIDOC CRM v7.1.3 (February 2024) are not intended transfer errors. 
   FORTH appreciates your feed-back on such errors.

8. CRM time extension 1.0 Encoded in RDFS (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)
   Since the Time Primitive of the CRM can not directly be implemented in RDF Triple Stores, we define in this extension
   of 4 properties replacing P81 and P82 adequately using xsd:dateTime. 
   Property P81 is dedicated for modeling the Time-Span's maximum known temporal extent i.e. ongoing_throughout. 
   Property P82 is for modeling the minimum outer bounds of events i.e. at_some_time_within. 
   P81 has its time interval redefined by P81a and P81b. Similarly, we redefine P82 by P82a and P82b.
## RDFS Generation Policies

### Sources

Policies followed for the RDFS implementation of CIDOC v.7.1.3 were created w.r.t.:

- Implementing the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model in RDF (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Resources/implementing-the-cidoc-conceptual-reference-model-in-rdf)
- How to implement CRM Time in RDF (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)
- CIDOC-CRM SIG feedback and the general guidelines:
  - Each property is declared twice, forward and backwards, unless no inverse name is defined in parentheses, or domain or range is interpreted as literal
  - All Primitive Values become rdfs:Literal
  - All IsA declarations from/to and between Primitive values are ignored

### Policies

#### **A. CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS**

The CIDOC-CRM model defines classes, that in Triple Stores are typically implemented as primitive values. These classes are all subclasses of `E59 Primitive Value` and in RDFS they are interpreted as Literal. There are some classes in the CIDOC-CRM model that are both subclasses of `E59 Primitive Value` and E41 Appellation. So far we have followed the decision by CRM-SIG in "Issue 394: Solution for Dualism of E41 Appellation and rdfs:label" in 28-11-2018 wrt the question whether these classes should be implemented as rdfs:Class or still be interpreted as rdfs:Literal.

In this version we have followed the following policy regarding CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS:

> A1. CIDOC Classes that are subClasses of `E59 Primitive Value` are interpreted as rdfs:Literal regardless of whether they are also subClasses of another Class.

As a result, the following CIDOC classes were not defined in RDFS:

- `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E60 Number`
- `E61 Time Primitive`
- `E62 String`
- `E94 Space Primitive`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive`

Additionally, the following isA relationships were not defined in RDFS:

- `E59 Primitive Value` `subClassOf` `E1 CRM Entity`
- `E60 Number` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E61 Time Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E61 Time Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E62 String` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E94 Space Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E94 Space Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`

#### **B. CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS**

The decisions in policy A affect the implementation of CIDOC Properties in RDFS. A property cannot define an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:domain, and the backwards direction of a property with an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:range cannot be created for the exact same reason.

Further, the property ranges defined as rdfs:Literal in this implementation do not inherit the properties of the superclasses defined in the CIDOC Model. A separate guideline will describe how to instantiate such properties if at all needed.

Another aspect considered for the implementation of properties in RDFS is whether a distinct inverse property definition should be provided.

In this version we followed the following policies regarding CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS:

> B1. CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever no inverse name for the property has been specified in parentheses in the official CIDOC documentation and property domain is not equal with property range.

As a result, the following properties do not define an inverse direction.

- `E1 CRM Entity. P3 has note: E62 String`
- `E19 Physical Object. P57 has number of parts: E60 Number`
- `E52 Time-Span. P79 beginning is qualified by: E62 String`
- `E52 Time-Span. P80 end is qualified by: E62 String`
- `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`
- `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`
- `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`
- `E53 Place. P171 at some place within: E94 Space Primitive`
- `E53 Place. P172 contains: E94 Space Primitive`
- `E90 Symbolic Object. P190 has symbolic content: E62 String`

> B2. CIDOC Property forward direction is **not** defined whenever property domain is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Similarly, CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever property range is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Further, the instances of classes interpreted as rdfs:Literal, cannot express in RDFs their **inherited** properties that could be expressed according to CIDOC Model.

As a result,

a) The following **direct forward direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:

- `E95 Spacetime Primitive. P169 defines spacetime volume (spacetime volume is defined by): E92 Spacetime Volume`
- `E61 Time Primitive. P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span`

b) The following **direct backwards direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:

- `E94 Space Primitive. P168i defines place (place is defined by): E53 Place`

> B3. Whenever no backwards/inverse property name is specified and property domain matches with property range, then the forward/direct property direction should be used for **both** directions and **no backwards/inverse property** needs to be defined.

As a result, we did not implement a separate backwards/inverse direction for the following CIDOC Properties:

- `E53 Place. P121 overlaps with: E53 Place`
- `E53 Place. P122 borders with: E53 Place`
- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with: E92 Spacetime Volume`
- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P133 is spatiotemporally separated from: E92 Spacetime Volume`

Additionally, all aforementioned redundant backwards/inverse CIDOC Property direction references, are replaced by the respective direct/forward CIDOC Property direction.

- The hierarchical link of  `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132i` was replaced with `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132`.

#### **C. Labels and appellations**

CIDOC-CRM version 7.1.3 defines the below subpropertyOf relations:

- `P168 place is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`
- `P169i spacetime volume is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`
- `P170i time is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`

The range of P168, P169i and P170i is `E94 Space Primitive`, `E95 Spacetime Primitive` and `E61 Time Primitive` respectively, which are all subclasses of `E41 Appellation` and interpreted as `rdfs:Literal` in RDFS, i.e. these three properties are datatype properties. However, the P1 property has range E41 Appellation, i.e. this property is an object property. Since OWL 2 distinguishes between object subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Object_Subproperties), data subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Data_Subproperties) and annotation subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Annotation_Subproperties), and also in OWL-DL the subject and object of a subproperty statement must be either both datatype properties or both object properties (see here (https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#subPropertyOf-def)), we do not include these three subPropertyOf relations in the provided RDFS implementation to avoid inconsistencies when reasoning with OWL 2 and OWL DL. Instead, we provide them in a separate ‘supplementary’ RDFS file which one can use if such inconsistencies are not expected.

In addition, since in the current practice, the property `rdfs:label` is widely used to denote appellations (see CRM-SIG Issue 394 (http://cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-394-solution-for-dualism-of-e41-appellation-and-rdfslabel)), the following `subPropertyOf` relation was also included in the supplementary RDFS file:

- `rdfs:label` subPropertyOf `P1 is identified by`

Note that according to the RDF Schema 1.1 specification, the domain (or range) of a property does not necessarily need to be 'subClassOf' or 'equal' to the domain (or range) of its superproperties. By including this subproperty relation, one can either directly use `rdfs:label` for providing a non-URI identifier/appellation for an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` for associating an additional URI-identifier with an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` and create an intermediate node (i.e. a URI-identifier for instance of `E41_Appellation`) for providing more detailed information about this appellation.

#### **D. Implementing Value Intervals**

The following are property pairs needed to simulate the interval-valued primitive values foreseen by the CRM:

> D1. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'maximum known temporal extent' boundaries specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.

As a result, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E52 Time-Span. P81a end of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)
- `E52 Time-Span. P81b begin of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)

> D2. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'minimum outer bounds' specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.

Consequently, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E52 Time-Span. P82a begin of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)
- `E52 Time-Span. P82b end of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)

> D3. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`, for the upper and lower boundaries specification of `E60 Number`.

Consequently, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E54 Dimension. P90a has lower value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)
- `E54 Dimension. P90b has upper value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)

#### **E. Multiple ISA custom declaration Classes**

The following are declarations of frequently used multiple instantiations as classes with respective multiple IsA (so far only one):

> E1. addition of a new class, defined as subClassOf `E41 Appellation` and `E33 Linguistic Object`, for all Appellations being regarded
specific to or characteristic for a language group and being described indirectly via a URI.

As a result, we have created the following class definition:

- `E33_E41_Linguistic_Appellation` subClass of `E33_Linguistic_Object` and `E41_Appellation`

#### **F. Translations and Scope notes**

> F1. **Translations** Each RDFS Class or Property definition is accompanied by a set of translations expressed as rdfs:labels separated by xml:lang tags. The translation label used for each language is **the most recent** still **valid** translation. Still valid translation may be interpreted in the following ways:

- The English label of the `CurrentVersion` that the current RDFS file is referring to is *almost equal* (accepting only differences regarding multiple spaces) to the English label of the `TranslationVersion` that the translated label was created for. For example, in order to accept a translation for `E22 Human-Made Object` in the CurrentVersion (7.1.3) we should have a translation for E22 that was created based on a CIDOC version that used the same name for E22. The class name of E22 was changed from `E22 Man-Made Object` to `E22 Human-Made Object` in version 6.2.7. So the only **valid** translations would be these that were created based on version 6.2.7 or later. Currently no such translation has been created, so `E22 Human-Made Object` in CurrentVersion (7.1.3) does not define any translation in the RDFS file.

- Another option is to qualify translations as **valid** based on the scope note comparison of `CurrentVersion` and `TranslationVersion`. Since scope notes include formatting information, the comparison should ignore formatting changes.

Currently in this version we follow the option to qualify translations as valid based on the comparison of the respective labels in the corresponding CIDOC versions.

> F2. **Scope notes** are defined as rdfs:comment and include only the text of the official CIDOC-CRM version in English language. Since scope notes are not just simple texts but include formatting data, a simple removal of the formatting data does not always produce a readable format. Therefore we followed the below simple conventions for the transformation of CIDOC-CRM scope note text into a readable rdfs:comment:

- Each Paragraph defines a new line
- Each element in an unordered list defines a new line
- Each element in an ordered list defines a new line prefixed with `'{order}. '`
- Each superscript text is separated from its base with `'-'`
- Each subscript text is separated from its base with `'_'` (none found)

> F3. **Scope notes of Inverse Properties**. Scope notes for the inverse/backwards direction of properties are not defined as they are covered by the definition of the direct/forward direction definition. Whenever the direct/forward property direction of a property `Pxxx` is not defined due to policy **B1**, then its scope note is used as scope note for the inverse/backwards property `Pxxxi`, and labeled as `Scope note for 'Pxxx':`.

As a result, the direct/forward property definition was used for the rdfs:comment definition of

- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P169i spacetime volume is defined by: rdfs:Literal`
- `E52 Time-Span. P170i time is defined by: rdfs:Literal`

This is the implementation approved by the 58th CRM-SIG meeting (March 2024)
as the current RDFS version for the CIDOC CRM namespace.
Note that this is NOT a definition of the CIDOC CRM, but a CIDOC CRM compatible implementation
of an RDF Schema derived from the authoritative release of the CIDOC CRM v7.1.3 on February 2024
https://cidoc-crm.org/Version/version-7.1.3 by an automated algorithm. It is intended for an
assumed majority of uses. Depending on the application, users may create adequate extensions 
compatible with the logical definitions of the CIDOC CRM.

Created by FORTH-ICS February 13, 2024
CC BY 4.0 https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode



Encoding Rules:
1. The RDF spelling rules do not allow blanks. Hence we have replaced them by underscores.
   For instance "E63_Beginning_of_Existence" or "P2i_is_type_of".

2. RDF does not allow to instantiate properties beginning from a range value.
   Therefore, each CRM property is represented as two RDFS properties.
   For instance "P2 has type (is type of)" is represented as:
   "P2_has_type" for the domain to range direction and "P2i_is_type_of" for the range to domain direction.

3. The primitive values "E60 Number", "E61 Time Primitive", "E62 String", "E94 Space Primitive" and 
   "E95 Spacetime Primitive" referred in the Model for formal completeness are interpreted as rdfs:literal.

4. RDF does not support properties of properties, therefore, users may create their own
   subProperties for CRM properties that have a type property such as "P3 has note":
   Instead of P3 has note (P3-1 has type : parts description) declare
   <rdf:Property rdf:about="P3_parts_description">
      <rdfs:domain rdf:resource="E1_CRM_Entity"/>
      <rdfs:range rdf:resource="http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#Literal"/>
      <rdfs:subPropertyOf rdf:resource="P3_has_note"/>
   </rdf:Property>

5. Scope notes are represented as <rdfs:comment> elements.

6. In addition this encoding contains labels in languages different from English, 
   which are taken from translations of previous versions of the CIDOC CRM.    

7. Any other differences in labels, scope notes  and semantic relationships of this encoding 
   to the authoritative definition of the CIDOC CRM v7.1.3 (February 2024) are not intended transfer errors. 
   FORTH appreciates your feed-back on such errors.

8. CRM time extension 1.0 Encoded in RDFS (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)
   Since the Time Primitive of the CRM can not directly be implemented in RDF Triple Stores, we define in this extension
   of 4 properties replacing P81 and P82 adequately using xsd:dateTime. 
   Property P81 is dedicated for modeling the Time-Span's maximum known temporal extent i.e. ongoing_throughout. 
   Property P82 is for modeling the minimum outer bounds of events i.e. at_some_time_within. 
   P81 has its time interval redefined by P81a and P81b. Similarly, we redefine P82 by P82a and P82b.
## RDFS Generation Policies

### Sources

Policies followed for the RDFS implementation of CIDOC v.7.1.3 were created w.r.t.:

- Implementing the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model in RDF (http://www.cidoc-crm.org/Resources/implementing-the-cidoc-conceptual-reference-model-in-rdf)
- How to implement CRM Time in RDF (http://old.cidoc-crm.org/docs/How_to%20implement%20CRM_Time_in%20RDF.pdf)
- CIDOC-CRM SIG feedback and the general guidelines:
  - Each property is declared twice, forward and backwards, unless no inverse name is defined in parentheses, or domain or range is interpreted as literal
  - All Primitive Values become rdfs:Literal
  - All IsA declarations from/to and between Primitive values are ignored

### Policies

#### **A. CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS**

The CIDOC-CRM model defines classes, that in Triple Stores are typically implemented as primitive values. These classes are all subclasses of `E59 Primitive Value` and in RDFS they are interpreted as Literal. There are some classes in the CIDOC-CRM model that are both subclasses of `E59 Primitive Value` and E41 Appellation. So far we have followed the decision by CRM-SIG in "Issue 394: Solution for Dualism of E41 Appellation and rdfs:label" in 28-11-2018 wrt the question whether these classes should be implemented as rdfs:Class or still be interpreted as rdfs:Literal.

In this version we have followed the following policy regarding CIDOC Classes implementation in RDFS:

> A1. CIDOC Classes that are subClasses of `E59 Primitive Value` are interpreted as rdfs:Literal regardless of whether they are also subClasses of another Class.

As a result, the following CIDOC classes were not defined in RDFS:

- `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E60 Number`
- `E61 Time Primitive`
- `E62 String`
- `E94 Space Primitive`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive`

Additionally, the following isA relationships were not defined in RDFS:

- `E59 Primitive Value` `subClassOf` `E1 CRM Entity`
- `E60 Number` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E61 Time Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E61 Time Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E62 String` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E94 Space Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E94 Space Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` `subClassOf` `E41 Appellation`
- `E95 Spacetime Primitive` `subClassOf` `E59 Primitive Value`

#### **B. CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS**

The decisions in policy A affect the implementation of CIDOC Properties in RDFS. A property cannot define an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:domain, and the backwards direction of a property with an rdfs:Literal as rdfs:range cannot be created for the exact same reason.

Further, the property ranges defined as rdfs:Literal in this implementation do not inherit the properties of the superclasses defined in the CIDOC Model. A separate guideline will describe how to instantiate such properties if at all needed.

Another aspect considered for the implementation of properties in RDFS is whether a distinct inverse property definition should be provided.

In this version we followed the following policies regarding CIDOC Properties implementation in RDFS:

> B1. CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever no inverse name for the property has been specified in parentheses in the official CIDOC documentation and property domain is not equal with property range.

As a result, the following properties do not define an inverse direction.

- `E1 CRM Entity. P3 has note: E62 String`
- `E19 Physical Object. P57 has number of parts: E60 Number`
- `E52 Time-Span. P79 beginning is qualified by: E62 String`
- `E52 Time-Span. P80 end is qualified by: E62 String`
- `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`
- `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`
- `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`
- `E53 Place. P171 at some place within: E94 Space Primitive`
- `E53 Place. P172 contains: E94 Space Primitive`
- `E90 Symbolic Object. P190 has symbolic content: E62 String`

> B2. CIDOC Property forward direction is **not** defined whenever property domain is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Similarly, CIDOC Property backwards/inverse direction is **not** defined, whenever property range is interpreted as rdfs:Literal (A.1). Further, the instances of classes interpreted as rdfs:Literal, cannot express in RDFs their **inherited** properties that could be expressed according to CIDOC Model.

As a result,

a) The following **direct forward direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:

- `E95 Spacetime Primitive. P169 defines spacetime volume (spacetime volume is defined by): E92 Spacetime Volume`
- `E61 Time Primitive. P170 defines time (time is defined by): E52 Time-Span`

b) The following **direct backwards direction** CIDOC Properties **cannot** be expressed and are **not defined** in RDFS:

- `E94 Space Primitive. P168i defines place (place is defined by): E53 Place`

> B3. Whenever no backwards/inverse property name is specified and property domain matches with property range, then the forward/direct property direction should be used for **both** directions and **no backwards/inverse property** needs to be defined.

As a result, we did not implement a separate backwards/inverse direction for the following CIDOC Properties:

- `E53 Place. P121 overlaps with: E53 Place`
- `E53 Place. P122 borders with: E53 Place`
- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with: E92 Spacetime Volume`
- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P133 is spatiotemporally separated from: E92 Spacetime Volume`

Additionally, all aforementioned redundant backwards/inverse CIDOC Property direction references, are replaced by the respective direct/forward CIDOC Property direction.

- The hierarchical link of  `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132i` was replaced with `P10i` subPropertyOf `P132`.

#### **C. Labels and appellations**

CIDOC-CRM version 7.1.3 defines the below subpropertyOf relations:

- `P168 place is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`
- `P169i spacetime volume is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`
- `P170i time is defined by` `subPropertyOf` `P1 is identified by`

The range of P168, P169i and P170i is `E94 Space Primitive`, `E95 Spacetime Primitive` and `E61 Time Primitive` respectively, which are all subclasses of `E41 Appellation` and interpreted as `rdfs:Literal` in RDFS, i.e. these three properties are datatype properties. However, the P1 property has range E41 Appellation, i.e. this property is an object property. Since OWL 2 distinguishes between object subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Object_Subproperties), data subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Data_Subproperties) and annotation subproperties (https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/REC-owl2-syntax-20121211/#Annotation_Subproperties), and also in OWL-DL the subject and object of a subproperty statement must be either both datatype properties or both object properties (see here (https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#subPropertyOf-def)), we do not include these three subPropertyOf relations in the provided RDFS implementation to avoid inconsistencies when reasoning with OWL 2 and OWL DL. Instead, we provide them in a separate ‘supplementary’ RDFS file which one can use if such inconsistencies are not expected.

In addition, since in the current practice, the property `rdfs:label` is widely used to denote appellations (see CRM-SIG Issue 394 (http://cidoc-crm.org/Issue/ID-394-solution-for-dualism-of-e41-appellation-and-rdfslabel)), the following `subPropertyOf` relation was also included in the supplementary RDFS file:

- `rdfs:label` subPropertyOf `P1 is identified by`

Note that according to the RDF Schema 1.1 specification, the domain (or range) of a property does not necessarily need to be 'subClassOf' or 'equal' to the domain (or range) of its superproperties. By including this subproperty relation, one can either directly use `rdfs:label` for providing a non-URI identifier/appellation for an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` for associating an additional URI-identifier with an instance of `E1 CRM Entity`, or use `P1 is identified by` and create an intermediate node (i.e. a URI-identifier for instance of `E41_Appellation`) for providing more detailed information about this appellation.

#### **D. Implementing Value Intervals**

The following are property pairs needed to simulate the interval-valued primitive values foreseen by the CRM:

> D1. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'maximum known temporal extent' boundaries specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.

As a result, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E52 Time-Span. P81a end of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)
- `E52 Time-Span. P81b begin of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P81 ongoing throughout: E61 Time Primitive`)

> D2. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`, for the 'minimum outer bounds' specification of `E61 Time Primitive`.

Consequently, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E52 Time-Span. P82a begin of the begin: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)
- `E52 Time-Span. P82b end of the end: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E52 Time-Span. P82 at some time within: E61 Time Primitive`)

> D3. addition of two new properties, defined as subproperties of `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`, for the upper and lower boundaries specification of `E60 Number`.

Consequently, we have created the following property definitions:

- `E54 Dimension. P90a has lower value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)
- `E54 Dimension. P90b has upper value limit: rdfs:Literal` (subPropertyOf `E54 Dimension. P90 has value: E60 Number`)

#### **E. Multiple ISA custom declaration Classes**

The following are declarations of frequently used multiple instantiations as classes with respective multiple IsA (so far only one):

> E1. addition of a new class, defined as subClassOf `E41 Appellation` and `E33 Linguistic Object`, for all Appellations being regarded
specific to or characteristic for a language group and being described indirectly via a URI.

As a result, we have created the following class definition:

- `E33_E41_Linguistic_Appellation` subClass of `E33_Linguistic_Object` and `E41_Appellation`

#### **F. Translations and Scope notes**

> F1. **Translations** Each RDFS Class or Property definition is accompanied by a set of translations expressed as rdfs:labels separated by xml:lang tags. The translation label used for each language is **the most recent** still **valid** translation. Still valid translation may be interpreted in the following ways:

- The English label of the `CurrentVersion` that the current RDFS file is referring to is *almost equal* (accepting only differences regarding multiple spaces) to the English label of the `TranslationVersion` that the translated label was created for. For example, in order to accept a translation for `E22 Human-Made Object` in the CurrentVersion (7.1.3) we should have a translation for E22 that was created based on a CIDOC version that used the same name for E22. The class name of E22 was changed from `E22 Man-Made Object` to `E22 Human-Made Object` in version 6.2.7. So the only **valid** translations would be these that were created based on version 6.2.7 or later. Currently no such translation has been created, so `E22 Human-Made Object` in CurrentVersion (7.1.3) does not define any translation in the RDFS file.

- Another option is to qualify translations as **valid** based on the scope note comparison of `CurrentVersion` and `TranslationVersion`. Since scope notes include formatting information, the comparison should ignore formatting changes.

Currently in this version we follow the option to qualify translations as valid based on the comparison of the respective labels in the corresponding CIDOC versions.

> F2. **Scope notes** are defined as rdfs:comment and include only the text of the official CIDOC-CRM version in English language. Since scope notes are not just simple texts but include formatting data, a simple removal of the formatting data does not always produce a readable format. Therefore we followed the below simple conventions for the transformation of CIDOC-CRM scope note text into a readable rdfs:comment:

- Each Paragraph defines a new line
- Each element in an unordered list defines a new line
- Each element in an ordered list defines a new line prefixed with `'{order}. '`
- Each superscript text is separated from its base with `'-'`
- Each subscript text is separated from its base with `'_'` (none found)

> F3. **Scope notes of Inverse Properties**. Scope notes for the inverse/backwards direction of properties are not defined as they are covered by the definition of the direct/forward direction definition. Whenever the direct/forward property direction of a property `Pxxx` is not defined due to policy **B1**, then its scope note is used as scope note for the inverse/backwards property `Pxxxi`, and labeled as `Scope note for 'Pxxx':`.

As a result, the direct/forward property definition was used for the rdfs:comment definition of

- `E92 Spacetime Volume. P169i spacetime volume is defined by: rdfs:Literal`
- `E52 Time-Span. P170i time is defined by: rdfs:Literal`

"This class comprises associations between an instance of any class, and signs or arrangements of signs that are used to refer to and identify that instance. Signs include alphanumeric characters, ideograms, notations such as chemical structure symbols, sound symbols, etc. The scripts or type sets for the symbols used to compose an instance of F12 Nomen have to be sufficiently specified. Spelling variants are regarded as different nomens, whereas the use of different fonts (visual representation variants) or different digital encodings do not change the identity. An arbitrary combination of signs or symbols cannot be regarded as an appellation or designation until it is associated with something in some context. In that sense, the F12 Nomen class can be understood as the reification of a relationship between an instance of E1 CRM Entity and an instance of E41 Appellation. Two instances of F12 Nomen can happen to be associated with equivalent strings and yet remain distinct, as long as they refer to distinct instances of E1 CRM Entity. Furthermore, two instances of F12 Nomen referring to the same instance of E1 CRM Entity may be associated with equivalent strings, and remain distinct as long as they are associated with distinct properties of the F12 Nomen class (for example, having the same spelling in different languages, or being defined in different controlled vocabularies). An instance of F12 Nomen associates a combination of signs with an instance of E1 CRM Entity on the basis of a cultural or linguistic convention: by associating a string with anything, the instance of F12 Nomen establishes a meaning that is not inherent in the instance of E62 String that is associated with it. Depending on context of use, nomens associated with equivalent strings can be associated with instances of different things in the real world even within the same language (polysemy and homonymy). Conversely, the same thing can be referred to through any number of nomens (synonymy). In the controlled environment of a bibliographic information system, though, homonymy is avoided Instances of F12 Nomen are assigned and associated with instances of E1 CRM Entity either formally (such as by bibliographic agencies) or informally through common usage.

"This class comprises distinct intellectual ideas conveyed in artistic and intellectual creations, such a poems, stories or musical compositions. A Work is the outcome of an intellectual process of one or more persons. Inherent to the notion of work is the existence of recognisable realizations of the work in the form of one or more expressions. Works are often regarded as finished and discrete e.g. when declared as such by the creator of the work or based on the elaboration or logical coherence of its content. However, works may be recognized as existing but unfinished e.g. if the creators deliberately or accidentally never explicitly finished a particular Expression but have left behind partial expressions. In the absence of explicit information about the initial conception, which is rarely available, the first expression created constitutes witness of the beginning of existence of a Work. A Work can evolve over time, such as through revised editions. A Work may be elaborated by one or more Actors simultaneously, in parallel, or over time. Additional expressions of a Work can continue to be created over time. The boundaries of a Work have nothing to do with the value of the intellectual achievement but only with the dominance of a concept.

The substance of F2 Expression is signs. An Expression is the outcome of the intellectual or creative process of realizing a Work. Subsequent expressions conveying the same work may be created over time. Expressions do not depend on a specific physical carrier and can exist on one or more carriers simultaneously. As far as bibliographic practice is concerned, only instances of F2 Expression that are externalised on physical carriers other than both the creator’s brain and an auditor’s brain are taken into account. The form of F2 Expression is an inherent characteristic of the F2 Expression. Differences in form imply different Expressions (e.g., from text to spoken word, a transcript of a recording). Similarly, differences in language or means of performance imply different Expressions (e.g., translations or arrangements for different instruments). Thus, if a text is revised or modified, the result is considered to be a new F2 Expression. While theoretically any change in signs will result in a new Expression, conventionally the context and use will determine the rules for distinguishing among expressions.

It can happen that a given item, or subset of items, originally produced, or intended to be produced, with a certain value for a particular kind of dimension, has a different value for this kind of dimension by accident.

The property can be used to group variant, alternative or related works that are considered to share a common concept. Whereas instances of F1 Work are always realised in instances of F2 Expression, there is no particular expression that fully conveys the instance of Conceptual Object that a work may be a member of. Intended usage of the property includes what is discussed as “superwork” in the library community. Typical examples are novels that can be grouped by fictional universes or common characters, paintings or graphical works that exist as a family of alternatives, musical compositions that are referred to as the same although they exist as particular versions that are each identified as an individual work. The instance of E28 Conceptual Object that has works as members will often be constructed for a specific purpose, such as bibliographic organization or retrieval."@en ;

This inference is an induction along the path that can be modelled as: F3 Manifestation. R7i is exemplified by: F5 Item. P43 has dimension (is dimension of): E54 Dimension. It can happen that a given item, or subset of items, originally produced, or intended to be produced, with a certain value for a particular kind of dimension, has a different value for this kind of dimension by accident. This fact should be recorded as a property of F5 Item, and not of F3 Manifestation."@en ;

This allows for describing the thing itself as a place that may contain other things, such as a box that may contain coins. In other words, it is the volume that contains all the points which the thing has covered at some time during its existence. The reference space for the associated place must be the one that is permanently at rest (P157 is at rest relative to) relative to the physical thing. For instances of E19 Physical Objects it is the one which is at rest relative to the object itself, i.e., which moves together with the object. For instances of E26 Physical Feature it is one which is at rest relative to the physical feature itself and the surrounding matter immediately connected to it. Therefore, there is a 1:1 relation between the instance E18 Physical Thing and the instance of E53 Place it occupies. We include in the occupied space the space filled by the matter of the physical thing and all its inner spaces.
This property implies the fully developed path from E18 Physical Thing through P196 defines, E92 Spacetime Volume, P161 has spatial projection to E53 Place. However, in contrast to P156 occupies, the property P161 has spatial projection does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.
In contrast to P156 occupies, for the property P53 has former or current location the following holds:
It does not constrain the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place.
It identifies a possibly wider instance of E53 Place at which a thing is or has been for some unspecified time-span.
If the reference space of the referred instance of E53 Place is not at rest with respect to the physical thing found there, the physical thing may move away after some time to another place and/or may have been at some other place before.

    rdfs:comment """This property associates an instance of E92 Spacetime Volume with an instance of E53 Place that is the result of the spatial projection of the instance of the E92 Spacetime Volume on a reference space.
In general, there can be more than one useful reference space (for reference space see P156 occupies and P157 is at rest relative to) to describe the spatial projection of a spacetime volume, for example, in describing a sea battle, the difference between the battle ship and the seafloor as reference spaces. Thus, it can be seen that the projection is not unique.
The spatial projection is the actual spatial coverage of a spacetime volume, which normally has fuzzy boundaries except for instances of E92 Spacetime Volume which are geometrically defined in the same reference system as the range of this property and are an exception to this and do not have fuzzy boundaries. Modelling explicitly fuzzy spatial projections serves therefore as a common topological reference of different spatial approximations rather than absolute geometric determination, for instance for relating outer or inner spatial boundaries for the respective spacetime volumes.
The spatial projection is unique with respect to the reference system. For instance, there is exactly one spatial projection of Lord Nelson’s dying relative to the ship HMS Victory, i.e. the location of his body relative to the ship HMS Victory at the time of his death.
In case the domain of an instance of P161 has spatial projection is an instance of E4 Period, the spatial projection describes all areas that period was ever present at, for instance, the Roman Empire.

The property does not necessarily state the quality or accuracy of this approximation, but rather indicates the use of the first instance of place to approximate the second.
In common documentation practice, find or encounter spots e.g. in archaeology, botany or zoology are often related to the closest village, river or other named place without detailing the relation, e.g. if it is located within the village or in a certain distance of the specified place. In this case the stated “phenomenal” place found in the documentation can be seen as an approximation of the actual encounter spot without more specific knowledge.
In more recent documentation often point coordinate information is provided that originates from GPS measurements or georeferencing from a map. This point coordinate information does not state the actual place of the encounter spot but tries to approximate it with a “declarative” place. The accuracy depends on the methodology used when creating the coordinates. It may be dependent on technical limitations like GPS accuracy but also on the method where the GPS location is taken in relation to the measured feature. If the methodology is known a maximum deviation from the measured point can be calculated and the encounter spot or feature may be related to the resulting circle using an instance of P171 at some place within.

An instance of E18 Physical Thing not only occupies a particular geometric space at each instant of its existence, but in the course of its existence it also forms a trajectory through spacetime, which occupies a real, that is phenomenal, volume in spacetime, i.e. the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume this property associates it with. This real spatiotemporal extent of the instance of E18 Physical Thing is regarded as being unique, in all its details and fuzziness; the identity and existence of the instance of E92 Spacetime Volume depend uniquely on the identity of the instance of E18 Physical Thing, whose existence defines it. It constitutes a phenomenal spacetime volume as defined in CRMgeo (Doerr &amp; Hiebel, 2013).
Included in this spacetime volume are both the spaces filled by the matter of the physical thing and any inner space that may exist, for instance the interior of a box. Physical things consisting of aggregations of physically unconnected objects, such as a set of chessmen, occupy a finite number of individually contiguous subsets of this spacetime volume equal to the number of objects that constitute the set and that are never connected during its existence.""" ;

Any instance of E29 Design or Procedure may be associated with other designs or procedures. The property is considered to be symmetrical unless otherwise indicated by P69.1 has type. The property is not transitive.
This property is a directed relationship. The P69.1 has type property of P69 has association with allows the nature of the association to be specified reading from domain to range; examples of types of association between instances of E29 Design or Procedure include: has part, follows, requires, etc.
Instances of this property are considered to be symmetric, in case no directed sense is provided for them by the property P69.1 has type.
The property can typically be used to model the decomposition of the description of a complete workflow into a series of separate procedures.""" ;

    rdfs:comment """This property describes the spatial location of an instance of E4 Period.
The related instance of E53 Place should be seen as a wider approximation of the geometric area within which the phenomena that characterise the period in question occurred, see below. P7 took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (frequently on the surface of the earth). For example, the period “Révolution française” can be said to have taken place in “France in 1789”; the “Victorian” period may be said to have taken place in “Britain from 1837-1901” and its colonies, as well as other parts of Europe and North America. An instance of E4 Period can take place at multiple non-contiguous, non-overlapping locations.
Any place where something happened includes the spatial projection of the happening given in the same geometric reference system. For instance, HMS Victory, as place of Lord Nelson's dying, includes the location of his body relative to the hull of HMS Victory at his time of death as the most precise location of his death. By the definition of P161 has spatial projection, an instance of E4 Period takes place on all its spatial projections to respective reference systems, that is, instances of E53 Place. Therefore, this property implies the more fully developed path from E4 Period through P161 has spatial projection, E53 Place, P89 falls within to E53 Place, where both places are defined in the same geometric reference system. The relation between an instance of E53 Place and its reference system can conveniently be documented via the property P157 is at rest relative to (provides reference space for).
Something that has happened at a given place can also be considered to have happened at a smaller place within it: for example, it is reasonable to say Caesar’s murder took place in Rome, but also on the Forum Romanum, and more precisely in the Curia. It is characteristic for different historical sources to use varying precision in such statements, without being in contradiction with each other. This may be due to lack of knowledge or to the relevance of the precision for the purpose of the statement. In information integration, the more precise statement improves the overall knowledge.""" ;

This property makes it possible to recognise the autonomous status of the incorporated signs, which were created in a distinct context, and can be incorporated in many instances of E73 Information Object, and to highlight the difference between structural and accidental whole-part relationships between conceptual entities.
It accounts for many cultural facts that are quite frequent and significant: the inclusion of a poem in an anthology, the re-use of an operatic aria in a new opera, the use of a reproduction of a painting for a book cover or a CD booklet, the integration of textual quotations, the presence of lyrics in a song that sets those lyrics to music, the presence of the text of a play in a movie based on that play, etc.
In particular, this property allows for modelling relationships of different levels of symbolic specificity, such as the natural language words making up a particular text, the characters making up the words and punctuation, the choice of fonts and page layout for the characters.
When restricted to information objects, that is, seen as a property with E73 Information Object as domain and range the property is transitive.
A digital photograph of a manuscript page incorporates the text of a manuscript page, if the respective text is defined as a sequence of symbols of a particular type, such as Latin characters, and the resolution and quality of the digital image is sufficient to resolve these symbols so they are readable on the digital image.

Since an instance of E90 Symbolic Object is defined as an immaterial idealization over potentially multiple carriers, any individual realization on a particular physical carrier may be defective, due to deterioration or shortcomings in the process of creating the realization compared to the intended ideal. As long as such defects do not substantially affect the complete recognition of the respective symbolic object, it is still regarded as carrying an instance of this E90 Symbolic Object. If these defects are of scholarly interest, the particular realization can be modelled as an instance of E25 Human-Made Feature. Note, that any instance of E90 Symbolic Object incorporated (P165) in the carried symbolic object is also carried by the same instance of E18 Physical Thing." ;

Like property P2 has type (is type of), this property is a consequence of the restricted focus of the CIDOC CRM. The aim is not to capture, in a structured form, everything that can be said about an item; indeed, the CIDOC CRM formalism is not regarded as sufficient to express everything that can be said. Good practice requires use of distinct note fields for different aspects of a characterisation. The P3.1 has type property of P3 has note allows differentiation of specific notes, e.g. “construction”, “decoration”, etc.

In the case of immaterial things, the instance of E64 End of Existence is considered to take place with the destruction of the last physical carrier.
This allows an “end” to be attached to any instance of E77 Persistent Item being documented i.e. instances of E70 Thing, E72 Legal Object, E39 Actor, E41 Appellation, and E55 Type. For many instances of E77 Persistent Item we know the maximum life-span and can infer that they must have ended to exist. We assume in that case an instance of E64 End of Existence, which may be as unnoticeable as forgetting the secret knowledge by the last representative of some indigenous nation.""" ;

This property is part of the set of temporal primitives P173 – P176, P182 – P185.

In other words, if A = [A-start, A-end] and B = [B-start, B-end], it means A-start ≤ B-end is true.
This property is part of the set of temporal primitives P173 – P176, P182 – P185.
This property corresponds to the disjunction (logical OR) of the following Allen temporal relations (Allen, 1983): {before, meets, met-by, overlaps, starts, started-by, contains, finishes, finished-by, equals, during, overlapped by}.
This property is not transitive.

- Speech transcriptions (e. g. interview recording) [structure model Transcriber]: link to media file, episodes, speech turns and word level timing with media files
- Multilingual/parallel [structure model TMX]: alignments on any structure (div, p...)
- As a table (e. g. answers to a survey, tweets) [structure model spreadsheet]: columns for metadata and columns for textual content

If only the fuzzy boundaries of the instances of E92 Spacetime Volume overlap, this property cannot be determined from observation alone and therefore should not be applied. However, there may be other forms of justification that the two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume must have some of their extents in common regardless of where and when precisely.
If this property holds for two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume then it cannot be the case that P133 is spatiotemporally separated from also holds for the same two instances. Furthermore, there are cases where neither P132 spatiotemporally overlaps with nor P133 is spatiotemporally separated from holds between two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume. This would occur where only an overlap of the fuzzy boundaries of the two instances of E92 Spacetime Volume occurs and no other evidence is available.

It documents known events in which an instance of E39 Actor has participated during the course of that actor’s life or history. The instances of E53 Place and E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instances of E39 Actor in the past. Collective actors, i.e. instances of E74 Group, may physically participate in events via their representing instances of E21 Persons only. The participation of multiple actors in an event is most likely an indication of their acquaintance and interaction.
The property implies that the actor was involved in the event but does not imply any causal relationship. For instance, someone having been portrayed can be said to have participated in the creation of the portrait.""" ;

    rdfs:comment """This property generalises the notions of “copy of” and “similar to” into a directed relationship, where the domain expresses the derivative or influenced item and the range the source or influencing item, if such a direction can be established. The property can also be used to express similarity in cases that can be stated between two objects only, without historical knowledge about its reasons. The property expresses a symmetric relationship in case no direction of influence can be established either from evidence on the item itself or from historical knowledge. This holds in particular for siblings of a derivation process from a common source or non-causal cultural parallels, such as some weaving patterns.
The P130.1 kind of similarity property of the P130 shows features of (features are also found on) property enables the relationship between the domain and the range to be further clarified, in the sense from domain to range, if applicable. For example, it may be expressed if both items are product “of the same mould”, or if two texts “contain identical paragraphs”.
If the reason for similarity is a sort of derivation process, i.e. that the creator has used or had in mind the form of a particular thing during the creation or production, this process should be explicitly modelled. In these cases, P130 shows features of can be regarded as a shortcut of such a process. However, the current model does not contain any path specific enough to infer this property. Specializations of the CIDOC CRM may however be more explicit, for instance describing the use of moulds etc.
This property is not transitive. This property is irreflexive.""" ;

    rdfs:comment """This property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an instance of E7 Activity.
This property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer.
Another example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.""" ;

    rdfs:comment """This property describes the active or passive presence of an E77 Persistent Item in an instance of E5 Event without implying any specific role.
It documents known events in which an instance of E77 Persistent Item was present during the course of its life or history. For example, an object may be the desk, now in a museum, on which a treaty was signed. The instance of E53 Place and the instance of E52 Time-Span where and when these events happened provide constraints about the presence of the related instance E77 Persistent Item in the past. Instances of E90 Symbolic Object, in particular information objects, are physically present in events via at least one of the instances of E18 Physical Thing carrying them. Note, that the human mind can be such a carrier. A precondition for a transfer of information to a person or another new physical carrier is the presence of the respective information object and this person or physical thing in one event.""" ;

    rdfs:comment """This property allows sub-typing of CIDOC CRM entities –a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus.
The CIDOC CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CIDOC CRM may by specialised into any number of sub-entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E41 Appellation, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL”, etc., none of which figures explicitly in the CIDOC CRM class hierarchy. A comprehensive explanation about refining CIDOC CRM concepts by E55 Type is given in the section “About Types” in the section on “Specific Modelling Constructs” of this document.
This property is a shortcut for the path from E1 CRM Entity through P41i was classified by, E17 Type Assignment, P42 assigned to E55 Type.""" ;
